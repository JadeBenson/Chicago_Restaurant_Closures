CS Winter 2021 Final Project:
Egemen Pamukcu, Jade Benson, Max Kramer, Sabina Hartnett

Libraries & Packages needed: 
Geopy (geopy.distance)

Begin with yapi-collect-searchquery
  Generates a list of coordinates to cover the city of Chicago to catch all businesses 
  Each teammate then ran "get_businesses" function on their list of coordinates in stages (to work around API search limit)
  Each teammate combined and then uploaded all their returned buisnesses to the CSVs folder (Sabina = "SH_all_business_query", Egemen = "egemen_all", Jade = "all_Jade_data", and Max = "mk_complete")
